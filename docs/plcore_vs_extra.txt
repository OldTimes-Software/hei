You're probably wondering what the rule of thumb is
when it comes to deciding if something is part of
the core or extras (or some other sub-library).

Basically if it's useful and widely used, then it's
probably worth adding it to plcore.

An example would be the loader for DOOM's WAD format,
which was of course originally designed for one game,
but has since gone on to be used in a large number of
different games and mods.
